4 months since his he started to build his shields up.

 


It was at 3 months that things started to return to an almost normal.

It happens while Luke and Leia grow in the Force. It happens while Owen and Beru Lars watch their new family and mourn the loss of their home. 

 


It happens a day before 10 months hit.

 


It happens….
