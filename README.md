# ao3_saver

At this time the ao3_saver is in it's most basic form, crawling one fandom's collection of stories to collect links and generate [text files](https://github.com/TR-1000/ao3_scraper/blob/master/sample_output/Back%20to%20the%20Past%20-%20Amalia2103%20-%20Multifandom%20%5BArchive%20of%20Our%20Own%5D.txt). I'm working on making this a full-on crawler that saves every story on AO3.
